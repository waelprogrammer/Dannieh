        <h3>Zahlane Cave in Sir Al-Dinniyeh</h3>
        <p>Zahlane Cave is one of the most remarkable natural landmarks in the Sir Al-Dinniyeh region of northern
          Lebanon. Known for its fascinating rock formations, the cave features stalactites and stalagmites sculpted
          over thousands of years by the slow seepage of water through limestone layers.</p>
        <p>Historical insights suggest that the cave may have once served as a refuge for ancient inhabitants and
          possibly as a storage or hiding place during times of conflict. Today, Zahlane Cave draws nature lovers and
          researchers alike, offering a breathtaking glimpse into Lebanon’s geological and historical richness.</p>

        <h3>Ottoman Era and Agricultural Expansion</h3>
        <p>During the Ottoman rule, Al Dannieh grew as an agricultural hub. The locals cultivated olives, figs, grapes,
          and cereals, shaping the socio-economic structure of the region. Traditional stone houses, many still standing
          today, were built during this period.</p>
        <p>The influence of the Ottoman architecture is still visible in village layouts and historical mosques.</p>

          traditional life remains strong.</p>

        <h3>The Story Behind Al-Jazzar Palace</h3>
        <p>An elegant modern hotel named Al-Jazzar Palace pays tribute to its founder, Al-Jazzar Raad—a member of the
          feudal family that once ruled the Dinniyeh region during the Ottoman era. The name blends traditional heritage
          with the European modernity that arrived during the French Mandate. Al-Jazzar's journey began as a poor farmer
          in the early 20th century, working the land alongside his mother. To sell their harvest, he would travel
          nearly 35 kilometers on a donkey through narrow mountain paths from his high-altitude village—about 800 meters
          above Tripoli—to the coastal city. This humble beginning paved the way for a legacy of ambition and
          transformation.</p>

        <h3>Eco-Tourism and the Mountain Trails</h3>
        <p>In recent years, Al Dannieh has become a popular destination for eco-tourism. Visitors are drawn to its green
          mountains, waterfalls, and hiking trails. Local initiatives promote sustainable tourism to preserve the
          region's pristine nature and provide economic opportunities.</p>
        <p>Dinniyeh includes the longest forest trail for hiking in the Middle East, stretching 75 kilometers. Over the
          past years, it has established its place on the map of hiking activities in Lebanon. It has become a key
          destination for some organized groups that traverse Lebanese regions on foot, most notably members of the
          "Mountain Trail".</p>
